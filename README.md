### Introduction
This is the code for the optimization of number of clusters in an unsupervised way by using two-step clustering approach.

This work is presented in SiPS 2020.

This paper proposes a method for optimizing theclusters employed as discrete random variables in probabilistic switching models. The proposed optimization facilitates obtaininga low number of discrete components while guaranteeing a high performance at predicting and detecting abnormalities in timeseries of data. Our method is composed of a two-step clustering approach that first considers a partitional clustering to obtainan initial semantic representation of data. Then it performs a hierarchical clustering to decrease the number of clusters while preserving coherent models employed for predicting future time instances at the testing phase. Odometry data from a real vehicle that performs different tasks in a closed, controlled environmentis used to evaluate the proposed method.

### Resources
You can use these codes with MATLAB 2018.
